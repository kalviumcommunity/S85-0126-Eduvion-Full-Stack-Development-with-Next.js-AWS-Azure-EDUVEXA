# EDUVEXA

## 📘 Project Overview

**EDUVEXA** is a modern, full-stack educational collaboration platform designed to improve visibility into student engagement and project progress. It leverages dashboards, peer feedback mechanisms, and analytics to enhance collaboration, accountability, and learning outcomes.

The project is built using an **industry-grade full-stack architecture** with Next.js, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Redis, Docker, and cloud deployment on AWS or Azure.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

Educational institutions often lack real-time visibility into how students engage with learning activities and collaborative projects. Instructors typically discover issues—such as low participation, uneven team contributions, or delayed progress—only after final evaluations. Students, in turn, lack clarity about their own performance, peer contributions, and areas for improvement.

This lack of transparency leads to:

* Poor collaboration in group projects
* Delayed instructor intervention
* Reduced student motivation
* Weaker learning outcomes

---

## 💡 Solution

EDUVEXA solves these challenges by combining **real-time dashboards** with **structured peer feedback mechanisms**. The platform provides continuous insight into engagement and progress while enabling students to actively participate in each other’s learning journey.

## 🔐 Environment Variable Management

This project uses environment variables to manage sensitive configuration securely.

### Environment Files
- `.env.local` – Stores actual secrets and local credentials (never committed)
- `.env.example` – Template showing required variables and their purpose

### Variables Used

#### Server-side only
- `DATABASE_URL`
  - PostgreSQL connection string
  - Accessible only on the server

#### Client-side safe
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`
  - Base URL for API requests
  - Safe to expose to the client

### Setup Instructions
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Replace placeholder values with real credentials
3. Restart the development server

### Common Pitfalls Avoided
- Never exposing secrets without `NEXT_PUBLIC_`
- Preventing `.env.local` from being committed
- Separating client and server variables clearly

## 🗄️ PostgreSQL Schema Design

This project uses a normalized relational database schema designed to support scalability, data consistency, and efficient querying for dashboards and collaboration features.

### Core Entities

#### User
- Represents a registered user (student or instructor)
- Each user can own multiple projects

**Key fields:**
- `id` – Primary Key
- `email` – Unique, prevents duplicate users
- `role` – Defines user type (STUDENT, INSTRUCTOR)

---

#### Project
- Represents an educational or collaborative project
- Each project belongs to exactly one user
- A project can have multiple tasks

**Key fields:**
- `id` – Primary Key
- `ownerId` – Foreign Key referencing `User(id)`

---

#### Task
- Represents an individual task within a project
- Each task belongs to one project

**Key fields:**
- `id` – Primary Key
- `projectId` – Foreign Key referencing `Project(id)`
- `status` – Enum (`PENDING`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `COMPLETED`)

---

### Relationships
- One **User → Many Projects**
- One **Project → Many Tasks**
- Foreign keys enforce referential integrity
- Cascading deletes ensure related data is cleaned automatically

---

### Constraints & Indexes
- Unique constraint on `User.email`
- Enum used for `Task.status` to prevent invalid values
- Indexes on frequently queried fields (`email`, `ownerId`, `projectId`, `status`) for faster dashboard queries

---

### Normalization
- Schema follows **Third Normal Form (3NF)**
- No duplicated data across tables
- Each table has a single responsibility
- Relationships are handled using foreign keys

---

### Why This Design Works
- Supports scalable dashboards and analytics
- Ensures data consistency and integrity
- Optimized for common queries like:
  - Fetching user projects
  - Listing tasks by project or status
  - Tracking project progress
